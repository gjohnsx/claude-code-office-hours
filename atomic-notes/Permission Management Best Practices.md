# Permission Management Best Practices

## Core Insight
Claude Code's permission system balances safety with productivity. Smart permission management can significantly speed up workflows while maintaining security.

## Permission Model

### Default Behavior
From Cal:
> "Out of the box what happens when you start our tool is for read actions, if Claude is searching or reading, we just let it go... but once it starts writing or running batch commands or doing things that could change stuff on your machine potentially, that's when we kick in this UI"

### Permission Categories
1. **Auto-allowed**: Read operations (grep, find, ls)
2. **Requires approval**: Write operations, bash commands
3. **Always dangerous**: System modifications, deletions

## Workflow Optimization Features

### 1. Auto-Accept Mode
Keyboard shortcut: **Shift+Tab**
> "If you're working with Claude Code and you press Shift+Tab, Claude'll just start working"

Use cases:
- Trusted operations
- Repetitive tasks
- Time-sensitive work
- Well-tested workflows

### 2. Command Whitelisting
Configure in settings:
```json
{
  "alwaysAllow": [
    "npm run test",
    "npm run build",
    "git status",
    "git diff"
  ]
}
```

Cal's advice:
> "If you just are tired of saying, 'Yes, run npm run test,' you can just always approve that"

### 3. Pattern-Based Permissions
Advanced configurations:
- Allow all npm scripts
- Allow read operations in specific directories
- Allow specific git commands
- Block dangerous patterns

## Permission Strategies

### Development vs Production
**Development Mode**:
- More permissive settings
- Auto-accept for common operations
- Faster iteration cycles
- Trust-based approach

**Production/Careful Mode**:
- Strict permissions
- Review all changes
- No auto-accept
- Audit trail focus

### Risk-Based Approach
**Low Risk** (Auto-approve):
- Test running
- Linting
- Type checking
- Read operations

**Medium Risk** (Quick review):
- File modifications
- Git operations
- Build commands
- Package updates

**High Risk** (Careful review):
- System commands
- File deletions
- Permission changes
- External network calls

## Best Practices

### 1. Progressive Trust
Start restrictive, gradually allow more:
```
Week 1: Review everything
Week 2: Auto-approve tests
Week 3: Auto-approve builds
Week 4: Shift+Tab for trusted tasks
```

### 2. Context-Aware Permissions
Different settings for different projects:
```markdown
# claude.md for personal project
Use Shift+Tab freely, auto-approve all npm commands

# claude.md for client work  
Always review file changes, no auto-approve
```

### 3. Team Coordination
Shared permission standards:
```markdown
# team-permissions.md
## Always Allow
- npm test
- npm run lint
- git status

## Never Auto-Approve  
- npm install
- Database migrations
- Deployment commands
```

## Security Considerations

### What to Never Auto-Approve
- System-level commands
- Package installations
- Credential access
- Network operations
- File deletions

### Safe Automation Patterns
```bash
# Create safe wrapper scripts
# safe-deploy.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "This will deploy to staging"
read -p "Continue? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    npm run deploy:staging
fi
```

## UI and Interaction

### Permission Dialog Options
- **Yes**: One-time approval
- **Yes, Always**: Permanent whitelist
- **No**: Deny and continue
- **Escape**: Interrupt Claude

### Quick Decision Making
Cal's tip on using Escape:
> "Escape is your best friend. While Claude is working, you can keep an eye on what it's up to and press Escape to stop it"

## Advanced Configuration

### Settings File Example
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "autoApprove": {
      "commands": [
        "npm test",
        "npm run build",
        "eslint ."
      ],
      "patterns": [
        "git status*",
        "git diff*",
        "cat *"
      ]
    },
    "alwaysDeny": {
      "patterns": [
        "rm -rf *",
        "sudo *",
        "*credentials*"
      ]
    },
    "requireConfirmation": {
      "timeout": 30,
      "default": "deny"
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment-Based Permissions
```bash
# Development
export CLAUDE_PERMISSIONS=relaxed

# Production
export CLAUDE_PERMISSIONS=strict
```

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Permission Logs
Track what's been approved:
- Command history
- Approval timestamps
- User decisions
- Automation triggers

### Review Patterns
Periodically review:
- What's frequently approved
- What's always denied
- Automation opportunities
- Security concerns

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Over-Permissive Settings
- Auto-approving too much
- Not reviewing changes
- Missing dangerous patterns
- Trusting too quickly

### 2. Under-Permissive Settings
- Constant interruptions
- Slow workflow
- Context switching
- Frustration buildup

### 3. Inconsistent Permissions
- Different settings per session
- No team standards
- Unclear automation rules
- Confusing behavior
